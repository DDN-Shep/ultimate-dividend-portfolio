# ultimate-dividend-portfolio
Ultimately an essential - powerful  - easy to use - dividend portfolio sheet.

## Instructions:

1. Install. That's necessary to give scripts access to your sheets.
In the top menu click "PORTFOLIO" > "Install"
1. Check _"Settings"_ sheet tab and choose your currency.
1. Cells you **should** change and add your own values are light or dark **YELLOW(ish)**.
1. IMPORTANT: **DO NOT edit any other cell**. Everything else is automatically populated.
1. That's all! You are ready. Just start adding your transactions to see the magic happen.

### Tooltips:

- Check for tooltips by hovering over the first row cells.
- I encourage you to chase tooltips ;D

### Sorting:

- Sorting is one of the best features and it has being kept in mind during development.
- Order doesn't matter, all entries can be added in any order. A striped triangle in the first row can be used for re-ordering. For instance, you can order the "Portfolio" by name. My preferred way is by weight (Sort Z - A).
- In the "Portfolio" section you can also drag and drop columns and rows to re-order (just don't delete them). How cool is that?
- Why not trying to sort by "Return %" or ex-dividend day? ;)

### Currency:

- Once your "home" currency is chosen in the Settings, it should not be changed as it will be used for exchange based on the value added in "Transactions".
- Tip: In "Transactions" your "home" currency exchange value will always be 1.

### Missing data in the "Portfolio" (Overrides):

- Sometimes the provider may not have the information for the ticker you entered. Showing N/A.
- Again, **DO NOT edit any grey cell** on the "Portfolio". Instead use the tab "Overrides" to enter the missing information you need.

### Find:

- Remember you can use "ctrl+f" ("cmd+f" on mac) to find for keywords in your sheet.

## ERROR Note:

If you see #ERROR! or Loading...

Try refreshing, if that does not work check that the ticker is correct and reload again.

Please please please. Do not email me reporting these errors. They are Google errors and seem to affect some people and not others. Good luck ;)

**If you follow the rules you should have a smooth experience.**
